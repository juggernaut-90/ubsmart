What is UB sMart
###################

UB sMart is an e­commerce system which will allow the students of UB to buy or sell pre­owned products. The system will require the student to create his / her login account using buffalo.edu email ID and, either list a new product for selling OR buy an already listed product. Seller will list the product under specific category and based of a particular set of questions, system will decide which Tier the product falls in ­ A, B or C (A being the most premium and C being the least). This will facilitate the user to learn the average, maximum and minimum price at which similar products have been sold / bought in the past. The system also makes use of a V irtual Wallet. When a buyer confirm an order, amount will be debited from his wallet and kept on hold. Upon receipt of confirmation from both buyer and seller that the product has been handed over, the system will release the amount and credit it to the seller’s V irtual Wallet.
